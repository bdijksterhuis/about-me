# Who is "Bryan Dijksterhuis"?

Hi, I am Bryan Dijksterhuis! 

I'm a senior/lead web developer with 13+ years of professional experience. 

I have built everything from full-stack web apps, to e-commerce platforms, to internal toolsets. 
My main focus is on the **JavaScript/Typescript** world, and the infrastructure that keeps everything running. But I am always eager to learn new things, so I'm open to a challenge!

I've led small teams, mentored junior devs, and shipped projects end-to-end. From concept, to production, to post-launch support.
